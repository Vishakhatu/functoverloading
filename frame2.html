        In brief Object-oriented programming is a notion found in C++ (also known as OOPS). We will talk about function overloading among the various attributes found in OOPS. Every programming language offers the ability to reuse previously written code by using functions. The number and type of parameters provided to a function are typically decided by the programmer based on the definition of the function. Function overloading is a further characteristic of programming languages that enable OOPS ideas in relation to functions. It makes reference to the possibility of having many functions with the same name but distinct parameters.
        
        Two or more functions may share the same name but not the same list of arguments when functional overloading occurs. It is a key characteristic of C++. Compile-time polymorphism and function overloading are similar concepts. A close examination reveals that the name stays the same, although the list of arguments, data type, and order all change. Take a look at a C++ function overloading example.
        
        The advantage of Function overloading is that it increases the readability of the program because you don't need to use different names for the same action.<br>
        In the aforementioned example, we can see that two functions are defined as a piece of code. The names of the functions are the same-"addPodium"-but the return type, the list of input arguments, and the data types for those arguments have been altered. <br> <strong>Function Overloading and Ambiguity -</strong>
        When the compiler is unable to decide which function is to be invoked among the overloaded function, this situation is known as function overloading.
        
        When the compiler shows the ambiguity error, the compiler does not run the program.
        <br><strong>
        Causes of Function Overloading:</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Type Conversion.</li>
            <li>Function with default arguments.</li>
            <li>Function with pass by reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Why is C++ Using Function Overloading?</b><br>
Over traditional structured programming languages, the OOPS ideas offer a number of benefits. Overloading functions is regarded as compile-time polymorphism. With the help of this OOPS idea, a programmer can create a function with the same name but a distinct execution pattern, enabling the code to be more understandable and reusable.

<b>What are the rules of function overloading in C++?</b><br>
    <span>When overloading a function in C++, there are some guidelines that must be observed. Let's take a closer look at a few of them:<br>
    
    1) The parameters for each function must be in a distinct order.<br>
    
    2) The functions have to be named the same.<br>
    
    3) The parameters for the functions must be distinct.<br>
    
    4) The parameters for the functions must be of various sorts.<br></span>
    <b>What are the types of function overloading in C++?</b><br><span>
        In C++, there are two types of function overloading. Those are<br>
        
        1) Overloading at compile time occurs when alternative signatures are used to overload the functions. The function's return type, number, and type of parameters are all regarded as the function's signature.<br>
        
        2) Overloading that occurs during runtime refers to the overloading of the functions. Time overloading occurs when a different number of parameters are added to the function during execution.<br></span>
        <b>What are the advantages of function overloading in C++?</b><br>
Here are a few benefits of function overloading in C++.<br>

1) The programmer can create functions with distinct purposes but the same name by using function overloading.<br>

2) It speeds up the program's execution.<br>

3) The code is clearer and simpler to comprehend.<br>

4) It reduces memory utilization and makes programs reusable.<br>

<b>What are the disadvantages of function overloading in C++?</b><br>
The following are some drawbacks of C++ function overloading.<br>

1) The primary drawback of function overloading is that it prevents the overloading of functions with various return types.<br>

2) The identical parameters cannot be overloaded in the case of a static function.
